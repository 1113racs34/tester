To use all you have to do is put your wallet address in the settings.js file.

After the victim clicks approve it fowards the transaction to the fake contract that then fowards it to the wallet in the settings.js file this is to make sure the attacker
doesnt get caught. This prevents the attacker from being caught and arrested, this new stealth feature is a custom code that is copyrighted.
